I have done this project as task 1 for the data analysis internship from letsgrowmore
Task 1: Iris Flowers Classification ML Project.
Level: Beginner
Domain: Data Science Intern
Programming Language: Python & ML
IDE: Jupyter Notebook
This particular ML project is usually referred to as the "Hello World" of Machine Learning. 
The iris flowers dataset contains numeric attributes, and it is perfect for beginners to learn about supervised ML algorithms, mainly how to load and handle data. 
Also, since this is a small dataset, it can easily fit in memory without requiring special transformations. capabilities.
